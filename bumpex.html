<h2>Bump Exercises<h2>
  
During Fall 2023, I tried to learn Daniel Bump's book "Automorphic Forms and Representations" by reading and doing some of the exercises. <br/>

I typed some of them out, even though lots (most) of my solutions are hand-waving, fake, or simply wrong. If you find any error in my file, please let me know. I would really appreciate it! <br/>
