  During Fall 2023, I tried to learn Daniel Bump's book <em>Automorphic Forms and Representations</em>
  by reading and doing some of the exercises. <br/><br/>

  I typed some of them out, even though lots (most) of my solutions are hand-waving, fake, or simply wrong.
  If you find any error in my file, please let me know. I would really appreciate it! <br/><br/>
