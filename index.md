## About
I am a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Brandeis University, currently studying automorphic representations. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Professor [Solomon Friedberg](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/solomon-friedberg/) and Professor [Omer Offen](https://sites.google.com/brandeis.edu/offen/home).

## Teaching

#### At Brandeis University
- Spring 2025: Math 10B - Calculus II
- Fall 2024: Math 10B - Calculus II
- Summer 2024: Math 15A - [Linear Algebra](./s2024la.md)
- Spring 2024: Math 10B - Calculus II
- Fall 2023: Math 10B - Calculus II

## Activities

#### B-Z Reading
- During Fall 2024, we are organizing a ["BC-Brandeis" student reading seminar](./bzf2024.html) on Bernstein and Zelevinsky's survey paper regarding the representation theory of p-adic groups. 

## Miscellaneous

#### Bump Exercises
- During Fall 2023, I tried to learn Daniel Bump's book "Automorphic Forms and Representations" by reading and doing some of the exercises. I typed [some of them](./docs/Exercise.pdf) out, even though lots (most) of my solutions are hand-waving, fake, or simply wrong. If you find any error in my file, please let me know. I would really appreciate it!

#### Notes
- [Algebra II](./docs/Algebra2notes.pdf), typed in Spring 2023 for Professor Olivier Bernardi. For a finer version, please refer to [Bernardi's Website](https://sites.google.com/brandeis.edu/bernardi/teaching).
