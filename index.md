## About

I am a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Brandeis University. I am currently studying automorphic representations. I am lucky to be co-advised by Professor [Solomon Friedberg](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/solomon-friedberg/) and Professor [Omer Offen](https://sites.google.com/brandeis.edu/offen/home).

## Miscellaneous

#### B-Z Reading
During Fall 2024, we are organizing a "BC-Brandeis" student reading seminar on Bernstein and Zelevinsky's survey paper regarding the representation theory of p-adic groups. 

Here is the schedule for it: [Link to schedule](./bzf2024.html).

#### Bump Exercises
During Fall 2023, I tried to learn Daniel Bump's book "Automorphic Forms and Representations" by reading and doing some of the exercises. I typed some of them out, even though lots (most) of my solutions are hand-waving, fake, or simply wrong. 

Here is a [copy](./docs/Exercise.pdf). If you find any error in my file, please let me know. I would really appreciate it!

#### Notes
[Algebra II](./docs/Algebra2notes.pdf), Spring 2023 by Professor Olivier Bernardi. This is a copy I typed after the lectures. For a serious version, please refer to [Bernardi's Website](https://sites.google.com/brandeis.edu/bernardi/teaching).
