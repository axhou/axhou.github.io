## About

I am a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Brandeis University. I am currently studying automorphic representations.

## Miscellaneous

#### B-Z Reading
During Fall 2024, we are organizing a "BC-Brandeis" student reading seminar on Bernstein and Zelevinsky's survey paper regarding the representation theory of p-adic groups. Here is the schedule for it: [Link to schedule](./bzf2024.html).

#### Bump Exercises
During Fall 2023, I tried to learn Daniel Bump's book "Automorphic Forms and Representations" by reading and doing some of the exercises. I typed some of them out, even though lots (most) of my solutions are hand-waving, fake, or simply wrong. 

Here is a [Link to another page](./docs/Exercise (28).pdf) . If you find errors in my file, please let me know. I would really appreciate it!
