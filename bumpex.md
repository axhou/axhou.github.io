During Fall 2023, I tried to learn Daniel Bump's book "Automorphic Forms and Representations" by reading and doing some of the exercises. I typed some of them out, even though lots (most) of my solutions are hand-waving, fake, or simply wrong. If you find any error in my file, please let me know. I would really appreciate it!
Here is a copy.
